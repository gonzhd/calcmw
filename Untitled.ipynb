    "# Molecular Weight Uncertainty Calcuation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the latest review of atomic masses the IUPAC has stated that some elements do not show a single atomic mass since there is substantial variation in the isotopic composition of the same materials around the world. For these cases, the atomic mass of an element is given as a range of possible masses. This range does not represent a statement of uncertainty but just the range of pssible values. In order to calculate the real uncertainty related with the calculation of molecular weights by addition of the atomic weights of the constituent elements we have to do error propagation."
